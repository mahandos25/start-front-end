	<h1>THIS SITE FOR POWERLIFTERS</h1>

<header> <p> <strong>Powerlifting</strong> is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually, odd lifts became standardized to the current three.</p>

<p>In competition, lifts may be performed equipped or un-equipped (typically referred to as 'classic' or 'raw' lifting in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not un-equipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and un-equipped lifting. Weight belts, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from un-equipped lifting.</p>

<p>Competitions take place across the world. Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport (bench press only) since 1984 and, under the IPF, is also a World Games sport. Local, national and international competitions have also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently of the <a target="blank" href="https://www.powerlifting.sport">IPF</a>.</p>

<h2>ABOUT ME!</h2>



<nav> <p>My name is <a target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/yevhenii_hrushetskyi?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=">Hrushetskyi Yevhenii</a>. Iâ€™m a powerlifting coach.  I also have the title of master of sports among amateurs and professionals. I have my own training method. <br /> Multiple champion of Ukraine in the weight category up to 110 kg. I have experience working in group classes with children aged 11 and older. I divide my classes into several cycles, namely:</p>

<ol>


     <li>Introductory - duration of 3-6 weeks.  We study the basic exercises and practice the technique.</li>

     <li>Pumping - duration of 6-8 weeks.  We work with a moderate weight of 60-70% to pump muscle fibers</li>

     <li>Strength cycle - 4-6 weeks with alternating unloading days.  work with a weight of 80-95% of the maximum for 1-2 repetitions to achieve peak strength.</li>

     <li>10 days of rest.  Enumeration of percentages and weight and cycling is repeated again.</li>


</ol>

<h2>Meal Plan for a Powerlifter</h2>


<span>

	<p>Powerlifting is a sport based around short bursts of very heavy weight lifting. Fitness is not a key objective, and weight training sessions are usually very long in duration with long rest periods between sets.</p>

	<p>Explosive power is the main goal, and whilst a heavy body weight is an advantage, too much excess body fat can impair breathing and may be a hindrance. So whilst lean muscularity is not an objective, neither should the powerlifter carry too much fat.</p>

    <p>A powerlifter should eat for strength and with this muscle size will come, so a meal plan is not too dissimilar to that of an off-season bodybuilder. The key to healthy quality weight gain is to eat big and eat consistently throughout the day following a structured meal plan.</p>

    The following is a sample meal plan for one day for a powerlifter of around 230lbs (105kg) body weight to help gain strength. Rest is crucial in powerlifting, so often a powerlifter only trains two or three times per week. On non-training days, the only difference should be to workout nutrition.

	<p>As with all the meal plans this is merely a guide and must not be stuck to rigidly! Eat a variety of different meats / fish / alternatives, complex carbohydrates, fruit and vegetables every day, and drink plenty of water. Adapt the plan to suit your own needs and lifestyle according to your results and performance in the gym in order to keep the strength gains coming.</p>
